# MSc Thesis - Music Popularity prediction


This repository contains an R-notebook for the music popularity prediction performed as part of my MSc Thesis in Business Analytics and Management at the Rotterdam School of Management (EUR).

The aim of this thesis is to assess the performance of a Random Forest (RF) regression in accurately predicting the popularity score of contemporary songs (2000-2021) as extracted through the Spotify-API.
To make more nuanced inferences, the performance of the RF is compared to that of a simpler Multiple Linear Regression (MLR). Additionally, a RF is created on a further subset containing only songs released in 2021 (5,142 observations). 

Ultimately, the RF is also used to render a Variable Importance (VI) score for each independent variable.

Note: considering that Github only allows the upload of files of up to 50MB, only the subsets with the songs of 2000-2021 and 2021 are uploaded. The original complete dataset "artists.csv" can be found on https://www.kaggle.com/yamaerenay/spotify-dataset-19212020-160k-tracks.
